I feel like I can’t even talk to my mom about anything serious anymore, not since I left.","\n","^It always comes back to “aww, anak, this is why you should come back home and live with us,”","\n",{"#":"jayce annoyed"},"^or “Why do you keep going to the gym?

I thought Tita Andrea wasn’t even married?","\n",{"#":"cousin annoyed"},"^Did I miss something?

I do miss him.","\n","^Mom hasn’t really talked to me about it. I think it’s been hard for her, too.","\n","^I did try to call her the other day. I just said hello and she didn’t even recognize me over the phone.","\n",{"#":"cousin neutral"},{"#":"speaker Jasmine"},{"#":"jayce neutral"},"^How would she not know it's you? Maybe being dumb runs on your side of the family or something.","\n",{"#":"speaker Jayce"},{"#":"jayce annoyed"},"^Ha ha, very funny Ate.","\n",{"#":"jayce sad"},"^But I think it’s like, her brain refuses to recognize how my voice is now. I don’t know, it’s been so long but she’s still weird about me.","\n","^Has she… said anything to you?","\n",{"#":"speaker Jasmine"},{"#":"cousin worried"},"^No, she hasn’t said anything to me since the funeral for your dad last year. I think she only likes talking about other people rather than her own feelings.","\n",{"#":"jayce neutral"},"^Anyway... I don't know if she’d just change her thoughts after all these years all of a sudden.","\n",{"#":"cousin worried"},{"#":"speaker Jasmine"},"^A loss like this can sometimes be a catalyst for change.","\n",{"#":"jayce sad"},"^It could just be that she’s finally realizing that she can’t maintain a relationship with you without giving you the respect you deserve.","\n","^I’m sure she’s hurting too, and wants to hold onto the family she has left.","\n",{"#":"cousin neutral"},{"#":"speaker Jayce"},"^Hm…","\n",{"#":"jayce neutral"},"^Thanks again, Jasmine.","\n","^I’d like to talk to her if she’s willing to actually have a conversation instead of the usual lecturing and patronizing.","\n",{"#":"speaker Jasmine"},"^Again, why I came here in the first place. Might be worth giving that a shot, when you feel ready.","\n",{"#":"speaker Jayce"},"^Yeah, I’ll keep that in mind.","\n","^Anyway, it’s getting kinda late, are you going home?","\n",{"#":"jayce excited"},"^If not, I’d love to host you for dinner if you’re down?","\n",{"#":"cousin happy"},{"#":"speaker Jasmine"},{"#":"jayce neutral"},"^Sure!
